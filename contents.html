					</h2>
					<p>
					This kanji is intended to be a pictograph of the sun. It is easy
					to detect the circle and the big smile that characterize our simplest
					drawings of the sun-
					like those yellow badges with the words, “Have a nice day!” 
					</p>

					<img src="https://kanjihaiku.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/tsuki-moon.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2>
					<p>
					This character is actually a picture of the moon,
	 				with the two horizontal lines representing the left eye and mouth of the
					mythical “man in the moon.”
					(Actually, the Japanese see a hare in the moon, but it is a little farfetched to find one in the kanji.)
					And one month, of course, is one cycle of the moon.
    					</p>

					<img src="http://www.bayitlive.com/eBay/sb2/172/09.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2>
					<p>
					Just as sitting before a fire enlivens the imagination and lets you see almost anything you want to in the flames,
					this kanji is so simple it lets you see almost any sort of fire you want to see. <br>
					It no longer makes a good pictograph, but I invite you to take a pencil and paper and play with the form-
					first writing it as shown below and then adding lines here and there - to see what you can come up with.
					Everything from matchbooks to cigarette lighters to volcanic eruptions to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah have been found here. 
					No doubt you, too, will find something interesting to bend your memory around these four simple strokes.
					</p>

					<h2 id="k4">Water Kanji<br>
					<img src="http://redfinchjapanese.com/img/kanji/16.png" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2>
					<p>
					This character, which looks a bit like a snowflake, is actually a pictograph of water- 
					not any particular body of water or movement of water, but simply the generic name for water. 
					Should you have any difficulty remembering it, simply think of a walking stick being dropped vertically into the water, 
					sending droplets out in all four directions. Then all you need to learn is how to write it in proper order.
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

					<h2 id="k5">Tree Kanji<br>
					<img src="https://img00.deviantart.net/6b69/i/2004/11/9/7/kanji___tree.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2>
					<p>
					Here we see a pictograph of a tree, showing the main trunk in the long vertical stroke and the boughs in the long horizontal stroke.
					The final two strokes sweep down in both directions to indicate the roots. 
					Although it may look similar at first sight to the kanji for water, 
					the order in which it is written is completely different and this affects its final appearance.
					</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

					<h2 id="k6">Gold Kanji<br>
					<img src="http://www.ama-asian.com/example/gold.gif" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2><p>
					If this were not one of the most common characters you will ever have to write,
					I would apologize for having to give the explanation that follows.
					Anyway, we want to depict bars of a gold bullion with an umbrella overhead 
					to shade them from the heat (and perhaps to hide them as well). The bullion is made by melting down all the scepters of the kingdom, 
					drop by drop, and shaping them into bars. </p>

					<h2 id="k7">Soil Kanji<br>
					<img src="http://web.mit.edu/jpnet/ji/gifs/200x200/3758.gif" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2><p>
					I don’t like it any more than you do, but this kanji is not the	pictograph it is trumped up to be: 
					a mound of soil piled on the ground. All I can recommend is that you memorize it as it is.
					Anyway, it will be occurring with such frequency that you have almost no chance of forgetting it, even if you try
					</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


					<h2 id="k8">Left Kanji<br>
					<img src="https://stickerart.com.au/images/temp/images-products-0911-413-kanji-left-w500-c5.png" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2><p>
					Conveniently, the left has traditionally been considered the “sinister” side, where dark and occult crafts are cultivated.
					Note how the second stroke droops over to the left and is longer than the first.
					</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

					<h2 id="k9">Right Kanji<br>
					<img src="https://i0.wp.com/learnjapaneseonline.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/kanji-meaning-migi.jpg" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2><p>
					When thinking of the key word right, in order to avoid confusion with the previous kanji, 
					take advantage of the doublemeaning here, too. Imagine a little mouth hanging down by your side—
					like a little voice of conscience—telling you the right thing to do. 
					Here the second stroke should reach out to the right and be drawn slightly longer than the first.
					</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
					<p>______________________________________________________________</p>
					<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

					
					<h2 id="k10">Above Kanji<br>
					<img src="http://www5.big.or.jp/~otake/hey/kanji/gifmoji/f2/ue.gif" height="500px" width="500px">
					</h2><p>
					The two directions, above and below, are usually pointed at with
					the finger. But the characters do not follow that custom, so we
					have to choose something else, easily remembered. The primitives
					show a magic wand standing above a floor—“magically,”
					you might say. Anyway, go right on to the next frame, since the
					two belong together and are best remembered as a unit, just as
					the words above and below suggest each other.<p></center>
